# Odin Recipes

This is a simple recipe website project, created as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. The main goal of this project is to practice fundamental HTML and CSS skills by building a multi-page static website.

## Features

- A main index page with links to all recipes.
- Individual pages for each recipe, including images, ingredients, and instructions.
- Consistent and clean styling applied across all pages using external CSS stylesheets.
- A responsive layout that works on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the web pages.
- **CSS3:** For styling the pages, including layout, colors, and fonts.

## How to View

Since this is a static website, you can view it by following these steps:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

```

## Developer's Note

It's important to mention that I already have experience as a developer, which made it easier to achieve these results.

I hope this project serves as inspiration for programming beginners. Remember that with effort, dedication, and consistency, you'll be able to create even better websites than this one, especially since I was once a beginner like you. Keep studying and building!
