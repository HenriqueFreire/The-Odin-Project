        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Brigadeiro is an iconic Brazilian dessert, a must-have at birthday parties and celebrations. It's a creamy chocolate fudge, traditionally rolled into small balls and covered in sprinkles. Its simplicity to make and unmistakable flavor make it a national favorite.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can of condensed milk (395g)</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons of cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Chocolate sprinkles for coating</li>
            <li>Butter for greasing hands</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a thick-bottomed pan, combine the condensed milk, cocoa powder, and butter.</li>
            <li>Cook over low heat, stirring continuously with a spatula to prevent it from sticking to the bottom.</li>
            <li>Cook for about 10 to 15 minutes, or until the mixture starts to pull away from the bottom of the pan (the rolling point).</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture onto a greased plate and let it cool completely.</li>
            <li>With buttered hands, take small portions of the mixture and roll them into balls.</li>
            <li>Roll the balls in chocolate sprinkles until they are completely covered.</li>
            <li>Place the brigadeiros in paper cups and serve. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
