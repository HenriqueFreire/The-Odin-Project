        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Coxinha is one of the most popular and beloved snacks in Brazil. It consists of a flavorful dough filled with shredded and seasoned chicken, shaped into a teardrop (resembling a chicken thigh), breaded, and fried until golden and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the Filling:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500g of cooked and shredded chicken breast</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Chopped green onions and parsley to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of cream cheese (optional, for extra creaminess)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For the Dough:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of the chicken cooking broth</li>
            <li>2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Breading:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 beaten eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup of breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>Oil for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Filling:</strong> In a pan, heat the olive oil and sauté the onion and garlic. Add the shredded chicken, season with salt and pepper, and cook for a few minutes. Turn off the heat, mix in the green onions, parsley, and cream cheese (if using). Set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Dough:</strong> In another pan, bring the chicken broth, butter, and salt to a boil. As soon as it boils, add the flour all at once. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until the dough pulls away from the bottom of the pan, forming a ball.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to a smooth, lightly oiled surface. Knead the dough while still warm until it is smooth and even.</li>
            <li><strong>Shaping:</strong> Take small portions of the dough, flatten them in the palm of your hand, place a teaspoon of the filling in the center, and close it, shaping it into a coxinha (teardrop).</li>
            <li><strong>Breading and Frying:</strong> Dip each coxinha in the beaten eggs and then coat it well with breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Fry the coxinhas in hot oil until they are golden brown on all sides. Remove with a slotted spoon and place them on paper towels to drain the excess oil.</li>
            <li>Serve hot!</li>
        </ol>
